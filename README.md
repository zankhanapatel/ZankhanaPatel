Welcome to my profile! I hold a Master's degree in Computer Applications (Master of Computer Applications (MCA)). I have completed my industrial training as a developer.

I have three years of experience. I have experience with all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) from Software Design to Implementation to Integration. I specialize in meeting the needs of individuals. My core focus is on developing practical business solutions using a variety of
mature and proven plugins, components, and third-party solutions to address common small business website requirements.
